However, the unobtrusive, privacy-friendly object motion sensor-based systems face challenges such as scarce labeled data and ADL performer confusion in a multi-resident setting. This study adopts the design science paradigm to develop an innovative deep transfer learning framework for human identiﬁcation (DTL-HID) to address both challenges. A novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to automatically extract comprehensive temporal and cross-axial motion patterns for the DTL-HID framework. We rigorously evaluate the DTL-HID framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and alternative CNN designs). Results demonstrate our proposed DTL-HID framework can identify the ADL performer accurately even on a small amount of labeled data. We demonstrate a case study and discuss how stakeholders can further apply this approach to unobtrusive smart home monitoring for senior citizens. Beyond demonstrating the framework’s practical utility, we discuss two implications of our design principles to mobile analytics and design science research: (1) extracting temporal and axial local dependencies can capture richer information from multi-axial time-series data and (2) transferring knowledge learned on a relevant source domain with suﬃcient data can improve the performance of the desired task on the target domain with scarce data.","2020-04-02","2022-08-17 00:43:00","2022-10-29 20:54:33","2022-08-17 00:43:00","457-483","","2","37","","Journal of Management Information Systems","Human Identification for Activities of Daily Living","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Claim: ""Deep learning's superior performance over classical machine learning suggests that automatically learning feature representations rather than manually engineering features in an ad-hoc fasion enables more effective HID.""","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/NQI9T2BC/Zhu et al. - 2020 - Human Identification for Activities of Daily Livin.pdf","","design science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first use a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) method to identify medical terms in videos and then classify videos based on whether they encode a high or low degree of medical information. We then employ principal component analysis on aggregate video data to discover three dimensions of collective engagement with videos: non-engagement, selective attention driven engagement, and sustained attention driven engagement. Videos with low medical information result in non-engagement; at the same time, videos with a greater amount of encoded medical information struggle to maintain sustained attention driven engagement.

To attain sustainable competitive advantage from big data, firms must achieve agility in combining rich data across the organization to deploy analytics that sense and respond to customers in a dynamic environment. A key challenge in achieving this agility lies in the identification, collection, and integration of data across functional silos both within and outside the organization. Because it is infeasible to systematically integrate all available data, managers need guidance in finding which data can provide valuable and actionable insights about customers. Leveraging relationship marketing theory, we develop a framework for identifying and evaluating various sources of big data in order to create a value-justified data infrastructure that enables focused and agile deployment of advanced customer analytics. Such analytics move beyond siloed transactional customer analytics approaches of the past and incorporate a variety of rich, relationship-oriented constructs to provide actionable and valuable insights. We develop a customized kernel-based learning method to take advantage of these rich constructs and instantiate the framework in a novel prototype system that accurately predicts a variety of customer behaviors in a challenging environment, demonstrating the framework’s ability to drive significant value.","2018-04-03","2022-08-23 19:29:35","2022-10-27 15:49:34","2022-08-23 19:29:35","540-574","","2","35","","Journal of Management Information Systems","Advanced Customer Analytics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/XNYXG6BY/Kitchens et al. - 2018 - Advanced Customer Analytics Strategic Value Throu.pdf","","design science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But how can we identify these motives without requiring users to exert too much effort? Our research goal is to demonstrate that eye tracking can be used at the point of sale to do so. We focus on two frequently investigated shopping motives: goal-directed and exploratory search. To train and test a prediction model, we conducted two eye-tracking experiments in front of supermarket shelves. The ﬁrst experiment was carried out in immersive virtual reality; the second, in physical reality—in other words, as a ﬁeld study in a real supermarket. We conducted a virtual reality study, because recently launched virtual shopping environments suggest that there is great interest in using this technology as a retail channel. Our empirical results show that support vector machines allow the correct classiﬁcation of search motives with 80% accuracy in virtual reality and 85% accuracy in physical reality. Our ﬁndings also imply that eye movements allow shopping motives to be identiﬁed relatively early in the search process: our models achieve 70% prediction accuracy after only 15 seconds in virtual reality and 75% in physical reality. Applying an ensemble method increases the prediction accuracy substantially, to about 90%. Consequently, the approach that we propose could be used for the satisﬁable classiﬁcation of consumers in practice. Furthermore, both environments’ best predictor variables overlap substantially. This ﬁnding provides evidence that in virtual reality, information search behavior might be similar to the one used in physical reality. Finally, we also discuss managerial implications for retailers and companies that are planning to use our technology to personalize a consumer assistance system.","2020-09","2022-08-31 03:15:41","2022-09-14 19:01:40","2022-08-31 03:15:41","675-691","","3","31","","Information Systems Research","Eye-Tracking-Based Classification of Information Search Behavior Using Machine Learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/Y3QXUL5M/Pfeiffer et al. - 2020 - Eye-Tracking-Based Classification of Information S.pdf","","design science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location Protection against Machine-Learning Prediction Attacks in Social Networks","","","","","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3860803","User privacy protection is a vital issue in online social networks (OSNs). Even though users often intentionally hide their private information in OSNs, adversaries may conduct prediction attacks to predict the hidden information with advanced machine learning techniques. The private information that users intend to hide may still be at the stake of being exposed. By taking current city on Facebook as a case, we propose a solution to estimating and managing the exposure risk of users’ hidden information. First, we simulate an aggressive prediction attack by proposing a new current city prediction framework that integrates location indications from users’ various published information including demographic attributes, behaviors and relationships with advanced state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Second, we study on the prediction attack results to model the pattern of prediction correctness (as correct predictions lead to information exposures), and construct an exposure risk estimator. The proposed exposure risk estimator can not only notify users of the exposure risks of their hidden current city, but also help them mitigate the exposure risk by overhauling and selecting countermeasures. Moreover, it can improve OSNs’ privacy management by facilitating OSNs’ empirical studies on the exposure risks of collective users. While taking the current city as a case, this work sheds light on the protection of other hidden information against machine-learning prediction attacks, and reveals several insightful implications for both practice management and future research.","2021-06-05","2022-09-01 21:38:12","2022-10-29 20:55:28","2022-09-01 21:38:12","","","","","","","Is Hidden Safe?","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/WZV399RE/Han et al. - 2021 - Is Hidden Safe Location Protection against Machin.pdf; /Users/abe/Zotero/storage/PBNK22V5/papers.html","","design science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3860803","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predictive models treat documents as data to be classified, and document data are characterized by very high dimensionality, often with tens of thousands to millions of variables (words). Unfortunately, due to the high dimensionality, understanding the decisions made by document classifiers is very difficult. This paper begins by extending the most relevant prior theoretical model of explanations for intelligent systems to account for some missing elements. The main theoretical contribution is the definition of a new sort of explanation as a minimal set of words (terms, generally), such that removing all words within this set from the document changes the predicted class from the class of interest. We present an algorithm to find such explanations, as well as a framework to assess such an algorithm’s performance. We demonstrate the value of the new approach with a case study from a real-world document classification task: classifying web pages as containing objectionable content, with the goal of allowing advertisers to choose not to have their ads appear on those pages. A second empirical demonstration on news-story topic classification shows the explanations to be concise and document-specific, and to be capable of providing understanding of the exact reasons for the classification decisions, of the workings of the classification models, and of the business application itself. We also illustrate how explaining the classifications of documents can help to improve data quality and model performance.","2014-01-01","2022-09-01 18:37:13","2022-09-02 11:24:19","2022-09-01 18:37:13","73-99","","1","38","","MISQ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/JMNC4IWV/University of Antwerp et al. - 2014 - Explaining Data-Driven Document Classifications.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To combat these inefficiencies, we propose and evaluate SIGHT, a theoretical class of systems affording more robust signal evaluation during the job application process. A prototypical implementation of the SIGHT framework was evaluated using a mock-interview paradigm. Results provide initial evidence that SIGHT systems can elicit and capture qualification signals beyond what can be traditionally obtained from a typical application and that SIGHT systems can assess signals more effectively than unaided decision-making.

To address this gap, we first develop a data science approach to detect customer misbehavior on social media and then devise intervention strategies to deter it. Specifically, we build on natural language processing and deep learning techniques to automatically detect customer misbehavior by mining customers’ social media activities in collaboration with a leading apparel firm. The results show that our algorithmic solution achieves superior performance, improving detection by 7%–9% compared with traditional methods. We then implement two types of intervention policies based on the focus theory of normative conduct that advocates the use of injunctive norms (i.e., a punishment policy) and descriptive norms (i.e., a common identity policy) to restrain customer misbehavior. We conduct field experiments with the firm to validate these policies. The experimental results indicate that punishment considerably reduces customer misbehavior in the short term, but this effect decays over time, whereas common identity has a smaller but more persistent effect on misbehavior reduction. In addition, punishing dysfunctional customers decreases their purchase frequency, whereas imposing a common identity increases it. Interestingly, our results show that combining the two policies effectively alleviates the detrimental effect of punishment, especially in the long run. We examine the heterogeneous treatment effect on novice and experienced customers. Finally, a follow-up field experiment reveals that the disclosure of the use of an artificial intelligence detector improves the effectiveness of the intervention strategies, and this effect is more pronounced for the punishment and combination strategies.","2021-12","2022-09-01 12:24:34","2022-10-24 17:42:26","2022-09-01 12:24:34","1323-1346","","4","32","","","FairPlay","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/XAQIMQVT/Wu et al. - 2021 - FairPlay Detecting and Deterring Online Customer .pdf","","design science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the anonymity and increasing accessibility of these platforms, they are rich sources of cyber threats such as hacking tools, data breaches, and personal account information. As the number of products offered on DNMs increases, researchers have begun to develop automated machine learning-based threat identification approaches. A major challenge in adopting such an approach is that the task typically requires manually labeled training data, which is expensive and impractical. We propose a novel semi-supervised labeling technique for leveraging unlabeled data based on the lexical and structural characteristics of DNMs using transductive learning. Empirical results show that the proposed approach leads to an approximately 3-5% increase in classification performance measured by F1-score, while increasing both precision and recall. To further improve the identification performance, we adopt Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as a deep learning structure on top of the proposed labeling method. The results are evaluated against a large collection of 79K product listings obtained from the most popular DNMs. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in threat identification and is considered as an important step toward lowering the human supervision cost in realizing automated threat detection within cyber threat intelligence organizations.","2020-07-02","2022-09-01 11:48:07","2022-09-01 11:48:07","2022-09-01 11:48:07","694-722","","3","37","","","Semi-Supervised Cyber Threat Identification in Dark Net Markets","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07421222.2020.1790186","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/SG8AN6K7/Ebrahimi et al. - 2020 - Semi-Supervised Cyber Threat Identification in Dar.pdf","","","deep learning; cyber threats; Dark net marketplaces; long short-term memory; semi-supervised labeling; threat detection; transductive learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally they have been designed to work with one-dimensional ratings. With interest growing in recommendations based on multiple aspects of items, we present an algorithm for using multicomponent rating data. The presented mixture model-based algorithm uses the component rating dependency structure discovered by a structure learning algorithm. The structure is supported by the psychometric literature on the halo effect. This algorithm is compared with a set of model-based and instance-based algorithms for single-component ratings and their variations for multicomponent ratings. We evaluate the algorithms using data from Yahoo! Movies. Use of multiple components leads to significant improvements in recommendations. However, we find that the choice of algorithm depends on the sparsity of the training data. It also depends on whether the task of the algorithm is to accurately predict ratings or to retrieve relevant items. In our experiments a model-based multicomponent rating algorithm is able to better retrieve items when training data are sparse. However, if the training data are not sparse, or if we are trying to predict the rating values accurately, then the instance-based multicomponent rating collaborative filtering algorithms perform better. Beyond generating recommendations we show that the proposed model can fill in missing rating components. Theories in psychometric literature and the empirical evidence suggest that rating specific aspects of a subject is difficult. Hence, filling in the missing component values leads to the possibility of a rater support system to facilitate gathering of multicomponent ratings.","2012-03","2022-09-02 03:39:37","2022-09-02 03:39:37","2022-09-02 03:39:37","231-246","","1","23","","Information Systems Research","<b>Research Note</b> —The Halo Effect in Multicomponent Ratings and Its Implications for Recommender Systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/TCNRRV6G/Sahoo et al. - 2012 - Research Note —The Halo Effect in Multicomp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To suggest optimal strategies for concurrent page adaptation, the model analyzes each individual user’s browsing behavior, tests the effectiveness of different marketing and Web stimuli, as well as comparison shopping activities at other sites, and performs optimal Web page transformation. Data from an online retailer and a laboratory experiment reveal that concurrent learning of the user’s unobserved purchase intent and real-time, intent-based optimal interventions greatly reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase purchase conversions. If the concurrent, intent-based optimal page transformation for the focal site starts after the first page view, shopping cart abandonment declines by 32.4% and purchase conversion improves by 6.9%. The optimal timing for the site to intervene is after three page views, to achieve efficient learning of users’ intent and early intervention simultaneously.","2015-06","2022-09-02 03:35:00","2022-09-02 03:35:00","2022-09-02 03:35:00","339-359","","2","26","","Information Systems Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/2VPVP7MC/Ding et al. - 2015 - Learning User Real-Time Intent for Optimal Dynamic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phishing threats against employees can lead to severe security incidents, whereas those against the public can undermine trust, satisfaction, and brand equity. At the root of the problem is the inability of Internet users to identify phishing attacks even when using anti-phishing tools. We propose the phishing funnel model (PFM), a design artifact for predicting user susceptibility to phishing websites. PFM incorporates user, threat, and toolrelated factors to predict actions during four key stages of the phishing process: visit, browse, consider legitimate, and intention to transact. We used a support vector ordinal regression with a custom kernel encompassing a cumulative-link mixed model for representing users’ decisions across funnel stages. We evaluated the efﬁcacy of PFM in a 12-month longitudinal ﬁeld experiment in two organizations involving 1,278 employees and 49,373 phishing interactions. PFM signiﬁcantly outperformed competing models/methods by 8%–52% in area under the curve, correctly predicting visits to high-severity threats 96% of the time—a result 10% higher than the nearest competitor. A follow-up three-month ﬁeld study revealed that employees using PFM were signiﬁcantly less likely to interact with phishing threats relative to comparison models and baseline warnings. Furthermore, a cost-beneﬁt analysis showed that interventions guided by PFM resulted in phishing-related cost reductions of nearly $1,900 per employee more than comparison prediction methods. These results indicate strong external validity for PFM. Our ﬁndings have important implications for practice by demonstrating (1) the effectiveness of predicting user susceptibility to phishing as a real-time protection strategy, (2) the value of modeling each stage of the phishing process together, rather than focusing on a single user action, and (3) the considerable impact of anti-phishing tool and threat-related factors on susceptibility to phishing.","2021-06","2022-09-23 06:23:22","2022-10-27 15:29:50","2022-09-23 06:23:22","410-436","","2","32","","Information Systems Research","The Phishing Funnel Model","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/abe/Zotero/storage/GGJ3NR5B/Abbasi et al. - 2021 - The Phishing Funnel Model A Design Artifact to Pr.pdf","","design science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
