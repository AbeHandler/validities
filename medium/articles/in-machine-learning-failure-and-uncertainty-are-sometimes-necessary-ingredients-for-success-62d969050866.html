I originally wanted to become a physician, specializing in neuroscience, but I had failed the MCAT twice, which left me quite lost at the time. Graduating with a Philosophy degree, I felt quite unqualified to have any valuable skills to solve problems for others.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="bacb">My research at the time exposed me to data analysis, and so I figured Iâd give that career a shotâmainly because it sparked my curiosity. Starting from scratch, I taught myself SQL and was able to land a Data Analyst role. This initial step broadened my sights into the data world and my curiosity grew to an insatiable level.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="49c6">I was able to quickly master data analysis techniques and wanted to become a data scientist as I felt it more naturally fit who I was. This required a myriad of skill sets and experience that I did not have at the time. So I taught myself Python, mastered foundations in statistics and linear algebra, and enrolled in a Master of Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan while working and leading communities of practice.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="b94d">This work largely felt like my calling, as opposed to medicine. The concepts, from programming to math, came to me quite naturally and I was able to learn a large volume of information at a rapid pace. After graduating, I quickly found myself building enterprise machine learning systems to bring value to high-profile business projects.</p><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="9e5a"><strong class="ba">What challenges did you face once you entered the fieldâand how did you approach them?</strong></h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="b90e">There are more details to my journey, but the fundamental concept is that itâs rife with failure and uncertainty. For most of it, Iâve felt completely out of my depth and fighting an aggressive uphill battle.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="de4c">I approached these with three mental frameworks: insatiable curiosity, relentless drive, and collaborative growth. I was lucky to find a craft that fully piqued my fascination and was filled with theory and applications that I was deeply interested in.</p><blockquote class="nq"><p class="nr ns jg bm nt nu nv nw nx ny nz lz cn" id="9a91">To achieve exponential growth for yourself and for those around you, you should be doing it collaboratively.</p></blockquote><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh oa kq lj lk ob kt lm ln oc lp lq lr od lt lu lv oe lx ly lz iz ga" id="0b34">My drive comes primarily from knowing how much my parents sacrificed to give me a healthy and happy life and how close I was to throwing it away because I took too many things for granted. I never wanted to go back to that version of myself, so to do them and myself proud, I keep persevering.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="3d70">Finally, I believe that if you work as hard as you can but do it alone, youâll only achieve linear growth at best. To achieve exponential growth for yourself and for those around you, you should be doing it collaboratively. I wanted to be someone who used my skills and knowledge to help those around me, even if I wasnât the best at the current moment, and thatâs a principle I carry with me everywhere. Even with all that Iâm currently doing, I always have time to help.</p><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="9673"><strong class="ba">How do you choose the data-focused projects you work on?</strong></h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="f967">I mainly find myself drawn to Bayesian methods and Graph ML projects these days. I think those two methods are not only interesting ways to solve problems, but incredibly fascinating ways to look at the world. I think there is some cutting-edge work being done in Multi-Task Learning and Reinforcement Learning as well, but I havenât found many industry-ready applications for those just yet.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="03bb">In the next few months, I want to specialize further in building machine learning <em class="ma">systems</em> and not just machine learning <em class="ma">models</em>. TensorFlow has a great infrastructure to work on building systems that live far beyond a Jupyter Notebook. I think most organizations have enough people who can read sklearn docs and a handful of articles to do a basic machine learning setup in Jupyter, but there is still a large need to have specialists who know how to create value at scale from those models. MLOps feels a lot like the wild west right now, but Iâve come to love that uncertainty.</p><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="2d9a"><strong class="ba">What prompted you to start writing publicly about your career and other data-related topics?</strong></h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="47e9">I knew I wanted to create my own brand for a while now, but I wanted to get a better footing in this craft before starting. I have been doing photography for almost seven years now, so Iâve been really enticed by creating an online presence through a new art form. I started during my Capstone project for my Masterâs program, and initially established what kind of voice I wanted to have online before writing.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="f999">I noticed there was a large amount of content for beginners and a large amount of content for researchers, but it felt scattered and haphazard for the intermediate specialists looking to grow effectively and efficiently. I wanted to fit this niche, so I chose to do it by talking about methods and techniques in an applied way that discussed just enough theory to work on your own projects.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="e80f">The intermediate-to-advanced specialists donât need to be inundated with theory or to only have code snippets â they need just enough of both. So in a number of my pieces that walk through technical concepts, I offer just enough theory and pair it with code being applied to a dataset to guide a well-rounded understanding.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="f895">Also, Iâve always had a passion for teaching as I come from a family who used to be teachers in their past lives. I figured that writing about my thoughts and learnings was the fastest and most effective way to share what I have and learn from others as well.</p><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="c1e8"><strong class="ba">In your writing on TDS and elsewhere, you blend together several different interests. How do you go about choosing topics for your posts?</strong></h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="f86c">I start with the assumption that if Iâm struggling with or trying to understand something, itâs likely my peers are, too. I spend a lot of time reading about the problem, concept, or technique and then attempting to put my thoughts on it on paper. I am generally a person whose mind is always racing, so thereâs a never-ending stream of things Iâm curious about. This creates a flowing content engine that encompasses everything in the art, science, and philosophy of machine learning.</p><blockquote class="nq"><p class="nr ns jg bm nt nu nv nw nx ny nz lz cn" id="f0ff">Identifying your values and identity gives your content a personality; it gives people something to connect to.</p></blockquote><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh oa kq lj lk ob kt lm ln oc lp lq lr od lt lu lv oe lx ly lz iz ga" id="6347">I try to balance my writing by having a piece for others and having a piece for myself as much as I can. Iâll read a lot of blogs or articles, which gives me a good sense of what people are trying to learn or are struggling with, and then Iâll also have my own interest in things I want to learn and am curious about. Iâll try to do one for the readers and one for myself, and sometimes balance both needs in one story. Ultimately, though, I keep a sharp focus on what will provide someone with value.</p><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="1e4a"><strong class="ba">Do you have any advice for people who might want to write about their work, but arenât sure where to start or how to find the time?</strong></h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="2d41">I think itâs imperative to first start with knowing who you are. What things interest you? What kind of work are you most proud of? Identifying your values and identity gives your content a personality; it gives people something to connect to.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="f8ab">When I think about creating content, I think about it in three stages:</p><ol class=""><li class="of og jg lg b lh li lk ll ln oh lr oi lv oj lz ok ol om on ga" id="d227"><strong class="lg jq">Creating content for entertainment</strong>. This is base form as it may just inform of a new technique, or summarize a book or course, or clarify some concepts. The best of this stage can be informative and informational. This content generates views.</li><li class="of og jg lg b lh oo lk op ln oq lr or lv os lz ok ol om on ga" id="bd8f"><strong class="lg jq">Creating content with authenticity</strong>. This is when you add a flair of your own thoughts, ideas, and effort into the story. Itâs great you can talk about a new modeling technique in a book, but even better if you can add an anecdote of you trying it out and how it went, or contribute to the source material with your own voice. Adding your personal touch to content creates stories that people truly engage with. This content generates followers.</li><li class="of og jg lg b lh oo lk op ln oq lr or lv os lz ok ol om on ga" id="e33b"><strong class="lg jq">Creating content based in your values</strong>. The final form of content creation is when you identify what your values are, what you believe in, what you stand for, and then publicly reinforce them in various ways. Do you want to be someone who champions the ethical practice of AI? Write about that in your stories. As you talk about a new ML model, do research and talk about what kinds of new concerns it may bring to society. This is hard mainly because itâs difficult to sit down and know what your values are. Itâs okay to get things wrong and edit yourself along the way; start somewhere, fail, learn, improve, and iterate endlessly. This content generates partners.</li></ol><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="0de1">How do these stages translate to your writing workflow?</h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="0651">Thereâs nothing wrong with just creating content for entertainment or informational purposes, but know that creating your own brand is far more than regurgitating examples in package docs.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="0466">As for finding time to write, I think it can be tough and varies depending on what you want to write and how easily writing comes to you. If you only want to write about project-focused stories that have code in them, you may need a lot of upfront time to get things set up.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="dad5">Typically, I try to balance my writing with an adequate amount of reading. I always try to have a new book, article, or blog post with me (on my phone mainly) so I can be constantly reading, even if itâs a little bit at a time. The reason for this is it keeps my brain thinking about things in ways I wouldnât have otherwise. Iâm not arguing to have zero idle time, which is incredibly useful to have for creativity. Iâm advocating for creating your own content engine. Create ways for inspiration to come to you instead of you going to it.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="6265">The more I read, the more surface area I give myself to create new stories. Most of my time is not spent feeling super motivated and inspired; most of my time is spent feeling the opposite, in fact. And in those moments, itâs best to read. So then, when inspiration and energy strikes, Iâm ready to put my thoughts down and write.</p><h2 class="mr ms jg bm mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb ln nc nd ne lr nf ng nh lv ni nj nk jm ga" id="a02b"><strong class="ba">Looking towards the next year or two, what kinds of changes do you hope to see in data science as a field?</strong></h2><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh nl kq lj lk nm kt lm ln nn lp lq lr no lt lu lv np lx ly lz iz ga" id="6462">Iâm a hyper-techno optimist so thereâs a lot I hope to see in the future, but Iâll start with maybe the most controversial. I hope to see better-scoped machine learning projects. There are a lot of reasons ML projects donât go according to plan today, but I feel too many of them are due to them being led or proposed by people who may not fully understand machine learning and how to actively make data useful. Having people who have not done the work lead large-scale projects like these can be quite dangerous, as it leads to inaccurate timelines, burnt-out scientists and engineers, sub-quality systems built, and more.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="9cd9">There may be a lower barrier of entry to learning these concepts, but that should not be confused with a low barrier of excellence. Itâs a difficult craft to do right and, by consequence, a difficult craft to lead. The best projects I have ever worked on were led by scientists/engineers who have spent most of their career doing statistics or machine learning and evolved to learn the business. Obviously, that is a rarity, so I hope the future brings a more sensible and attainable approach to constructing projects with a high probability of success.</p><blockquote class="nq"><p class="nr ns jg bm nt nu nv nw nx ny nz lz cn" id="c249">Our ability to connect with each other and diversify the table where decisions are made is going to be a necessary step to creating systems that help more than hurt.</p></blockquote><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh oa kq lj lk ob kt lm ln oc lp lq lr od lt lu lv oe lx ly lz iz ga" id="a440">Iâm also terribly excited about data-centric ML. A laser focus on quality data is going to be an imperative step for the future of data science and tech. Whatever challenges weâre facing today with data (and there are a lot of them) are going to get exponentially harder as we start to become a technocentric society.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="a424">Technology has been our chosen weapon to combat societyâs toughest problems such as climate change, public health, etc. Whether we like it or not, we are heading toward a future where we have sensors, cameras, virtual assistants, and more integrated seamlessly into society. This brings about a plethora of ethical issues and data issues. This will require us to think far past Jupyter notebooks, and that is not a one-person job. Weâll need to become better about handling and deploying data at scale to deal with these new problems, and our best defense is our collaborative and collective nature. Open source, virtual communities, and broad sharing of knowledge are crucial parts of our ability to successfully build machine learning and AI systems to solve our most challenging issues.</p><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="4dbb">The field is evolving at a rapid pace with new models, tools, and papers released each day. Our ability to connect with each other and diversify the table where decisions are made is going to be a necessary step to creating systems that help more than hurt. Iâm deeply looking forward to work on solutions for complex problems with more people that inspire me.</p></div><div class="o dx ot ou ii ov" role="separator"><span class="ow fl ci ox oy oz"></span><span class="ow fl ci ox oy oz"></span><span class="ow fl ci ox oy"></span></div><div class="iz ja jb jc jd"><p class="pw-post-body-paragraph le lf jg lg b lh li kq lj lk ll kt lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz iz ga" id="7101">To explore more of Aniâs work, head over to his <a class="au pa" href="https://animadurkar.medium.com/" rel="noopener">Medium profile</a>, or follow him on <a class="au pa" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ani-madurkar-20a54183/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
