![Black and grey laptop computer turned on]()You’ve been asked to build a new data platform for your organisation. Exciting, right? Except, you’re more likely to fail than succeed.

[Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2015-09-15-gartner-says-business-intelligence-and-analytics-leaders-must-focus-on-mindsets-and-culture-to-kick-start-advanced-analytics) estimates that 60% of data projects fail, with some analysts suggesting that is a conservative estimate.

Here are some of the reasons I believe cause data projects to fail.

# No value placed in data

![Single dollar bill]()Data has become one of the most important business assets, but most organisations place no value in it. Data is often seen as an offshoot of functionality with little thought given to how it can be used to drive value in the organisation.

[“Data is the new oil”](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data) has become an oft-used phrase to describe the value of data. Crude oil is unrefined, and whilst it has some intrinsic value, it requires further processing before its true value is realised. Too many organisations are content to just collect crude data with little thought given to its refinement into useful products.

# No organisation-wide data strategy

![Stack of jigsaw puzzle pieces]()[Conway’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), usually applied to software development, states:


> organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure) of these organizations.
> 
> 

This law holds and is probably more accurate in the data space. It is common for each area of the organisation to store its data in a structure and place that only works for its use cases, with little thought given to how it may be shared or utilised by other areas of the organisation.

Without a centralised function working to define a organisation-wide solution data silos are likely to occur, with data stored in separate datastores. Even in the better scenario of data being stored in a centralised location, the data structures are not approached with an open-mindset. This leads to less obvious, but just as problematic silos.

# Technology-led solution

![Screen displaying programming code]()Immature organisations often see data as a technical problem that can be solved with technology, usually suggesting data is produced by technical systems and stored in technical solutions.

This leads to data solutions being worked on by technical teams in isolation from the rest of the organisation. Architecture of the data solution is often performed by software architects and developers with little context or understanding of the nuances of the data.

Naturally, this leads to sub-optimal solutions which either results in delivery of a platform that doesn’t work for the majority of end users or a long and tortuous delivery process resulting in lots of re-design and re-work.

# Lack of focus

![Blurry image of the word focus]()Organisations and their leaders are being seduced by the promise of increased performance born of data-driven decision making. This leads to statements from the top such as:


> Data is our number 1 priority.
> 
> Every area of our organisation must utilise data in their decision making.
> 
> No new product or system can be delivered without capturing data.
> 
> 

Whilst these sound like useful edicts they can have unexpected consequences. Often it instills a sense of “*data frenzy*” in organisations which results in ill-defined requirements and the capturing of data with no thought of how it can and will be used.

*Data frenzy* can also manifest itself in a demand to do everything at once because of the need to be seen to be “doing data”. This results in decisions being made with little focus on how this will benefit the organisation and more of a box-tick to ensure you are not accused of not doing the right thing.

# Neglecting the skills gap

![]()Organisations often have long-established datastores already in place. Data warehouses have been around a long time and they are used frequently to deliver analysis.

However, the skills used to deliver these and to analyse the data held within them are not the same as building a modern data platform and to provide deep and meaningful insight from the data held within.

Most organisations fail to understand that the transition to a modern data platform will require large skill shifts in the existing workforce and struggle to plan for the closure of the gap.

The demand for highly-skilled data-literate resources has surged in recent years and most organisations are not willing to invest in recruiting these individuals and are content to try to leverage their existing workforce. This is a false economy. Assuming you have a great data platform, you will get nowhere near the true value you could from it without great people working with it.

# Conclusion

Data projects most often fail due to people problems. Technical problems can usually be solved fairly easily, but people are a much harder and nuanced issue.

It is important to realise that for your data project to succeed it has to be a holistic approach, including people from all areas of your organisation working with an open, collaborative mindset.

Without this, your data project will (probably) fail.
