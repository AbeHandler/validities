## 87% of Data Science projects never make it to production. How can you increase the probability that your project survives?

As a Data Scientist, I have seen Data and AI projects succeed and fail at all stages: research, development, and deployment. To maximize success, I have identified three internal principals that increase the probability that a project will go into production and deliver meaningful value to clients. Learn how to keep your Data Science project out of the Data Science graveyard and instead get it into the hands of your users.

# 1. Define Business Value

<quote label="utility">
Everyday thousands of projects start around the world. There is a cost associated with each one. How do you determine your projects business value and ensure that costs will be secured? Before building a model, you must think: what will make this model successful from the perspective of the business team?</quote>

Here’s some examples:

* Product Recommendation System: increase in repeat customers who purchase, reduced checkout time, increased average purchase amount per customer
* Road Detection System: decreased number of accident, decreased number of insurance claims
* Disease Detection System: decreased medical costs
* Defective Product Identification: decreased number of returns for defective product, reduced return costs

<quote label="utility">
You may notice a common theme: money. Since the project has a cost, articulating the business value as a cost in addition to other benefits, is critical. Will you model save users time? Then calculate what the cost of a users time is or what they could be doing instead.
</quote>

Make sure you identify a method of measurement so that you can track the results throughout the process. Measurement should take place before the project begins, throughout testing and after deployment. Take note of the number of people who are using the model. You may not see measurable benefits until you have scaled to a large audience. Showing a manager that your project has increased repeat customers by 3X since implementation will create a convincing argument to grow model adoption or increase necessary funding.

# 2. Engage Key Stakeholders

Your key stakeholders are the model’s biggest cheerleaders. Data science models can be difficult to adopt and your key stakeholders have both influence with the users and peers who can impact your project.

Treat your key stakeholders like new homeowners on a house building project. They should be informed for each step of the project. Before starting the project, they should know the end product, the cost of the product and the time to completion. Early on, agree at which point the first release can take place.

The foundation of every model is **data**. Ensure key stakeholders know the materials that are used to build the model. They should be involved in data collection discussions that will build the foundation of a successful project. When building complex models where explainability is a challenge, having confidence in your data will help your stakeholders gain confidence to bring the model to production.

After deployment of the model, the Data Scientist may need to move onto the next project. Engaging with key stakeholders throughout the project will teach them how to care for the model. They should become familiar with all the ingredients and high level picture, so that their team can maintain and improve on the model in the future.

# 3. Build a prototype

Bring your data science project to life by creating a prototype for users to visualize the value and start initial testing. The sooner you can feasibly get to this point, the better. Many stakeholders and users may find it difficult to visualize the outcome and impact to them. A prototype will make this clear.

Many models require extensive testing and building a prototype will allow users to help contribute to the model improvement, allowing early testing and building a community that will help the model improve over time.

[IDEO founder David Kelly](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/fail_faster_succeed_sooner) said “fail faster to succeed sooner”. Take these steps to help put your project on track to success and focus on efficiently completing them. The sooner you can test your project throughout the steps, the sooner you will find — it may be time to take what you learned to a new idea.

# Final Thoughts

As a Data Scientist it’s important to recognize that some projects will not make it to production. These projects are not failures if you learn. I’ve learned the importance of value measurement, key stakeholders and prototypes. I’ve also paved the way for the future — instilling better data collection processes, fixing holes in business processes and introducing business users to new ways to use AI.
