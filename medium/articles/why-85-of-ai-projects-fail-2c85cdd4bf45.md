## Learn from other people’s mistakes. Life is too short to make them all yourself.

In order to this they hire a team with great skills, spend a vast amount of money on resources and after a few months ‘PUM’ **they find themselves at the starting point with less money and no trust at all for AI**. What mistakes have these companies made? Is AI just a hype and has no benefit at all? What lessons can we learn from so many failing projects?

# 1 — AI is not for everyone

Once your company decides to give AI a try, there is a need for a very clear and detail AI Strategy. **The foundation for an AI project is based on three pillars**, missing any of them makes the whole building tremble.

The three pillars:

* **Skills**: Data Scientist is a pretty recent job, very few Data Scientists can say they have more than 15–20 years of experience. Data scientist is a very scarce resources and it is difficult and expensive to get a proper team.
* **Technical Environment**: AI models are just part of the solution, if you want your project to succeed you need a variety of skills and solutions to make it possible. You need a team of software developers and engineers that handle the architectural complexity of AI projects. A well-designed production environment is a must and should not be managed by a Data Scientist.
* **Data**: Trash in, trash out. Companies must design a Data Strategy to manage the key resources for AI projects, data. Data Scientists are required to extract, clean and analyse data at any point. Working with outdated data, duplicates, incorrect or even missing information may lead a team through frustration and the project to fail. Data Governance is one of the most important and underrated pillars for the success of AI projects.

These three pillars are a must, if one of them is missing, AI projects may fail. I don’t know any team of Data Scientists with great tools, developing amazing models, without any data. Or even if your company has a great team and data how do you expect to move to the production of the model if you don’t have the required environment to do so.

Finally, it is also **important to consider the cultural impact this strategy shift can have on the company**. Many projects can fail because they don’t have the trust of management or the leaders of the company. AI is a tool, if the people managing it don’t use it, it will hardly have an impact on the business.

# **2 — AI starts in Profit and Loss statement**

Let’s say we have built our three pillars, how should we identify our AI project? How can we know which project to start with?

Most companies start with a technological orientation, sentences like ‘I want to be the first company to use chatbots!’, or ‘There is a brand-new technique released by Google, let’s use it!’ are the origin of failed projects. If you have this orientation it means **you are forcing a solution to a problem**, you have not identified how will you know what the proper solution is? **You should not start from the solution, but from the problem.**

**Instead of a technical orientation, companies should start by having a business orientation**. Analyse financial statements, find where the company suffering the highest costs. Continue with the customer acquisition and retention strategies, is there a way to improve it with AI? Identify first the problem and then decide which solution to apply.


**A business orientation allows companies to measure AI projects from a financial perspective**, we can estimate the cost, the revenue or impact it will have on the company with KPIs like ROI. Measuring AI projects this way can have two major benefits, first, it gives a clear orientation of where to go. AI teams can get lost on training models, trying new techniques and increase accuracy. <quote label="metrics">How many new techniques should they try or how much time should they spend on training? They should keep on working till they solve the business problem, that’s the only important KPI.</quote>

Secondly, **communication between the data scientist team and directors is usually not very fluent**. After months of working and doing a great job, the last thing you want to be missing is communication. For this we need to talk business language. **Explain your AI achievements in a language they can understand**, through financial KPIs.

If you are on your first project, the previous considerations should be taken into account twice. Failing in your first project can have political side effects on the development of the team and a loss of trust from the leaders. This could be even worse, it could lead the AI team to be frustrated and demotivated.

# **3 — End to end solution**

Putting a prototype model in production is a major milestone.

**Companies fail to spend too much time focusing on the model creation and lose sight of the original problem**. In software development, following an agile approach is key to the success of the project.

**Rather than waiting months to deliver an end software, it is better to work on tight, short iterations that rapidly produce outcomes**. After each iteration we receive feedback from our customers and users so we can improve. We have hypothesis of why the user will not love the solution, usually we might think of model accuracy or performance. Thanks to an agile approach we don’t work and build on hypothesis but on customer feedback.

Moreover, as we iterate and we create the full solution pipeline, business leaders can have early deliveries, enabling them to see the progress and the return on their investment. It helps to manage expectations and better understand user needs.

# 4 — In-house vs Outsource

Data Scientist are looking for new techniques and solutions to improve current model performance. They want to analyse the data, design the model, train it and fine-tune in each iteration. This task is highly consuming and requires very deep expertise, moreover it is extremely costly and takes time to have a reliable model.

On the other hand, we have big tech companies like Amazon, Google or Microsoft offering cutting-edge models, trained with such a vast amount of data that most companies can’t even imagine and develop those proficiency teams. Can we compete against them?

**Big cloud providers offer their trained models via API at a derisory price**. You pay per use, for thousands of API calls you can be charged cents (it depends on the model you are using). These out-of-the box models dramatically **reduce time to market** and **cost of entry**. Within days you can develop an AI pipeline at a very low cost, so you can gather users feedback.

**Can we use API for ever? Of course not**, as we have said, we work on short and tight iterations to deliver fast and this is why APIs are so useful. When you reach the point where your solution is validated, customers are using it, and leaders are willing to invest more money, you know your solution is working and has a clear return for your company. Once you have been able to validate all of this, you are ready to **move from APIs to develop your own models** and gain control over the solution. The same is valid for pre-trained model available online like ResNet, YOLO, BERT …

# Conclusion

Getting started in the AI world can be very challenging, there are many variables to consider and a lot of uncertainty. As we have read in this article, **most of the problems arise due to management and business decisions**. We must understand that AI is a tool that does not work on its own to solve a problem.

Recognize the problem, isolate it and understand it, then focus on your first pipeline which is key. At this early stage, you should **leave your perfectionism behind and focus on the end to end solution**. At this point you will be able to receive feedback and iterate over the solution.
