## If You’ve Never Failed, You’ve Never Lived

![]()Photo by [CHUTTERSNAP](https://unsplash.com/@chuttersnap?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)It’s quite normal to cast failure off in a bad light, it hurts to fail. But in reality, failure is not only inevitable for anyone that dares to try something new, it’s necessary. Embracing failure is the catalyst to exponential growth because within them lie valuable life lessons. Here’s the great thing about learning from failure… **They don’t have to be your own**.

Although we’ve known about Artificial Intelligence (AI) for many years, its application in industry is still very much in the nascent stages. Failures are to be expected. Sometimes the failures have been fatal and in other instances not quite so but all the same, the cracks in AI (or the wrong implementation of it) are shown and the confidence of the public is lost.

As practitioners, it’s our responsibility to practice AI safely hence it's worthwhile learning about times the technology has failed then proceeding to understand why it failed and what ought to be done differently. With that being said, here are 5 instances of when AI has failed.

## #1 Microsoft Tay

In my opinion, Chatbots have the potential to be one of the most valuable resources in technology. Advancements in the ability of computers to understand natural language have made it possible to develop technologies that can impersonate human-like interactions. Microsoft may have been thinking the same thing back in 2016 when they released Tay to Twitter.

The research team described Tay (short for **T**hinking **A**bout **Y**ou) as “The AI with zero chill”, something that people started to notice, especially when the bot started to make racist and derogatory remarks in response to other Twitter users.

Tay had used its AI skills to learn from interactions to have better conversations in the future. Before long, Twitter users began to target the vulnerabilities of the AI bot thence manipulating it to learn deeply sexist and racist sentiments.

Microsoft had to turn the bot off less than 24 hours after launching it. In a future statement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella remarked on the “great influence” Tay had on how Microsoft is approaching AI and the importance of accountability.

## #2 Amazon’s Recruiting Tool

![]()Photo by [Hello I'm Nik](https://unsplash.com/@helloimnik?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)Using AI to streamline talent acquisition is common in this day and age, however, it hasn’t always been the case. Once upon a time, if you were a woman seeking a technical role at Amazon, your chances were extremely slim.

Amazon had been building software that would automate the process of reviewing job applicants’ resumes with the intention of finding the top 5 talents since 2014. It was not until 2015, Amazon’s machine learning specialists discovered that their AI-powered recruiting tool was hiring for technical roles (i.e. software developer) in a way that was not gender-neutral.

It turns out Amazon had trained their machine learning algorithms on resumes that had been submitted to the company over a 10-year period. The majority of resumes came from men, since this is what was most common in technical roles, and the algorithms learned this pattern and determined women are not good suitors for technical roles.

I’ve previously written about the [different types of bias in data projects](/tackling-different-types-of-bias-in-data-projects-29e326660639). Also, you can read more about [Amazon’s sexist recruiting tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G).

## #3 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. Ball Tracking System

The Scottish football side, Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C., announced the launch of their new [AI-powered ball-tracking technology](https://ictfc.com/icttv-live-streaming-from-caledonian-stadium), in October of 2020. The announcement was made following 2 successful test events of the technology which had built up the confidence of the club.

In a matchup against Ayr United FC, the AI ball-tracking technology could not realize the success it had during the test runs. The system repeatedly confused the ball with the linesman’s bald head, especially when the ball was in unclear regions (i.e. being blocked by players or when it was in the shadows created by the stadium).

Short Video Detailing the IncidentIn hindsight, some fans may see the funny side of this incident but at the time, if you were a paying customer innocently trying to watch live football amidst a global pandemic, you would have been devastated.

Try not to laugh; It turns out the problem was caused as a result of the visual similarities between the linesman’s head and the ball. Other factors also affected the technology, such as the angle of the camera which gave the impression that the linesman's head was within the bounds of the football pitch.

## #4 Uber Self Driving Car Fatality

March 18th, 2018 will be recorded as a day in history to remember the life of Elaine Herzberg who was the victim of the first recorded pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving car.

The incident took place in Tempe, Arizona, USA. Herzberg was fatally struck by the Uber test vehicle whilst pushing a bicycle across a four-lane road. Uber was aware of the potential dangers of self-driving vehicles, hence they incorporated a human-in-the-loop system to serve as backup. However, [reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54175359) have claimed that the safety driver had been distracted by an episode of the voice on her phone and had in fact missed up to a third of the journey.

Full Breakdown on what happened during the Elaine Herzberg IncidentA [report by NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/self-driving-uber-car-hit-killed-woman-did-not-recognize-n1079281) stated the cause of the incident is down to the inability of the AI to “classify an object as a pedestrian unless that object was near a crosswalk”.

Following the incident, devastated and understandably so, Uber suspended the testing of self-driving vehicles in Arizona — a site in which such testing had been sanctioned since 2016.

## #5 Face ID Hacked Using a 3D Printed Mask

Facial recognition is cropping up everywhere nowadays, but it may not be as secure as we initially thought. Researchers have been able to find instances in which facial recognition has been fooled using a 3D-printed mask that depicts the face of the face used to authenticate the Facial ID system.

The video below provides more insight into this AI failure.

## Wrap Up

Failure typically comes at a cost and that cost grows with the more people that the failure impacts. Sometimes, we don’t have to wait to make our own mistakes to learn. Others have made mistakes ahead of us so we can learn and grow from them without having to pay the same cost as them. With that being said, learn to embrace failure that you may learn as it’s a sure way to grow.
