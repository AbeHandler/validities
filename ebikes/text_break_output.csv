/r/ebikes/comments/xtzzhi/advice_on_ebike_uni_student/iqt3744/,A 250W mid drive motor will be better than a 250W hub drive motor like the last ebike (also never heard of the brand of hub motor used in the last one - but still might be ok).

/r/ebikes/comments/xtzzhi/advice_on_ebike_uni_student/iqvyjnd/,Depends on a couple other factors.
/r/ebikes/comments/xtzzhi/advice_on_ebike_uni_student/iqvyjnd/,Do you plan on locking it up outside for extended periods of time?

/r/ebikes/comments/xtzzhi/advice_on_ebike_uni_student/iqvyjnd/,"Definitely don‚Äôt leave it outside for too long, and especially not overnight."

/r/ebikes/comments/xuuc6s/whats_the_honda_accord_hybrid_of_ebikes/iqxmgva/,I second that choice and also like the Gazelle Medeo City T9.

/r/ebikes/comments/xuuc6s/whats_the_honda_accord_hybrid_of_ebikes/iqy5iwb/,"The difference between the Gazelle &amp; the REI bike is that the T9 City is one of the cheapest (or the cheapest) options that Gazelle sells, with the least powerful motor it can source from Bosch; by contrast, the e2.2 is REI's top of the line bike, with a great Shimano motor, built to stand out above the other ebikes REI makes and sells."
/r/ebikes/comments/xuuc6s/whats_the_honda_accord_hybrid_of_ebikes/iqy5iwb/,"

I think comparing the CTY e2.2 to an Accord actually works well; I'd call the T9 City something like a Mercedes A Class - it uses good components and it's from a fantastic company, but it's the absolute entry-level model for that brand, and will have more compromised performance compared to the TOTL model from a less-upmarket (but still high-quality) brand."

/r/ebikes/comments/xuuc6s/whats_the_honda_accord_hybrid_of_ebikes/iqybqhe/,"I personally have the T9 HMB rather than the city, which has one step more powerful of a motor than the City, but that obviously drives the price up another 300 or 400 dollars."

All in all I ordered in early June and didn't have a fully functional bike until early September, but the replacement bike I got in early August at least ran but was just noisy until the right replacement motor got here."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,"The bike has decent components, frame welds are done so well they're barely visible, and it's a nice light weight versus other ebikes."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,"

Edit: the 500w Aventon keeps up with the 750w RadWagons and RadCity due to weight differences."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,The pedal assist (PAS) works differently between two companies which is frustrating to ride together but each has pros and cons.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,Aventon PAS levels (Pace 500 cadence sensor) change the target speed while Rad's (also cadence) changes the max wattage sent to the motor.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,"Rad's accessory options put Aventon's to shame, and not everything on Aventon's site will fit every bike within a model (example my first bike didn't have mount holes on forks but the 2nd one does)."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,The Pace 500 doesn't even have water bottle mounting holes.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is343kl/,I have to point out that Rad made bonehead decisions on the RadWagon 4 tires that impacts us but wouldn't impact the RadCity.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34dk4/,"I have a Gazelle T9, which is 2.7k, and there is a slightly less powerful T9 City for 2.4k."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34dk4/,They have some more solid models in the 3-4k range.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34dk4/,They‚Äôre a reputable brand.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34dk4/,"You could also check out Specialized, Orbea, and Trek, which have some good options in the 3-4k range."

/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34qmj/,"Re: your edit, something worth thinking about is whether you would prefer a hub or mid drive motor."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34qmj/,"The Lectric, and all of the other brands you listed, all will have hubs because this is common on cheaper bikes."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34qmj/,"Most higher-end bikes will be mid-drive, which means they feel more like riding an analog bike."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34qmj/,"But if you want a throttle and more intense boost, then hub might be your preference."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34qmj/,It would be good to test drive many different models and see what you think
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34uw9/,Have you considered getting an eBike from REI?
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34uw9/," They have their own in-house brand which sells bikes with pretty good components for as low as $1,500, and I believe if you get it from the store they'll assemble it for you."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is34uw9/," That way you can take your bike into their real, physical store (assuming you have one in your area) and have them fix it if anything goes wrong--REI stores have bike shops in them."

/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is363ly/,I‚Äôve never ridden a hub bike with a torque sensor.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is363ly/,"The only hubs I‚Äôve test ridden were two Rads, the Mission and then another (maybe the City or Runner) and I wasn‚Äôt much of a fan"
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is368im/,"I originally decided on the Aventon, as a local bike shop carried them."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is368im/," But at that time, they did not have throttle on demand, so I returned the bike."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is368im/, (Now they DO have throttle on demand).
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is368im/, So then I went with the Ride1Up 700.
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is368im/, I spent a Saturday afternoon carefully putting it together.

/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38y2u/,"Nothing major, but I had to take it into the shop to get the disc brakes trued because they were rubbing after I put the thing together, which I gather is a common issue."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38y2u/," I also had the controller come disconnected from being pulled loose once just doing normal riding--took me a few minutes to figure out what happened and it was kind of scary since the motor cut out entirely and their bikes aren't exactly lightweight, although I suppose that could happen with any bike."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38y2u/," Overall it was fine, but I've heard some people have had much worse experiences than I did."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"STOP, and read this."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"I think that as long as you understand and know the difference between a cadence and a torque sensor, none of these options would disappoint."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"

That said, the 700 and Radcity are both cadence sensor bikes where as the Aventon is a torque sensor bike."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"In my opinion, the type of sensor is one of the most important pieces to get right."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"When you pedal with a cadence sensor (even once or twice), the motor will engage to send the bike to the selected pedal assist speed."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"With a torque sensor, the motor will engage more and more, the harder you pedal."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"

So, if you‚Äôre sitting at a stop light on PAS 5 and accidentally trigger the cadence sensor, the bike is going to try and take off until you hit the brakes (the bikes you listed have a motor cut-off when the brakes are activated)."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"Some people, including myself, do not like that feeling."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"If you‚Äôre sitting at a traffic light and get on the pedals with a torque sensor, the bike isn‚Äôt really going to do anything until it detects you continuously pedaling."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"When you do pedal with a torque sensor, it‚Äôs going to feel like a regular bike, but it will be much easier to pedal."

/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"The bikes in cities (while usually beat up and rough riding) use a cadence sensor, so you could get a feel for it using one of those."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"Once you have that figured out, then you can make a more informed decision."

I was in the same boat as you though, so I‚Äôll tell you what I did."

/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"When I started looking, I went down to a local shop and rode a fat tire Aventon with a cadence sensor."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"At the time, I was looking at an Ariel Rider because of the stats."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"It was awesome, because it‚Äôs a bike with a motor, but I knew that ‚Äúuncontrollable‚Äù feeling (where the motor might go faster than I intended) was something I did not want."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"From there, I was able to narrow down the field by looking only at torque sensor bikes, and then further by other specs (motor wattage, battery, tire size, components)."

/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"The frame could be a little bigger so that the pedals don‚Äôt drag on a sharp turn, but that isn‚Äôt really a major issue if you‚Äôre riding correctly (turning right, you put your weight down on the left pedal to balance the bike, so the pedal won‚Äôt drag anyways)."
/r/ebikes/comments/y2h1bk/overwhelmed_with_options_which_company_is_best/is38yhj/,"The look of the bike is that of a classic mountain bike (which was another factor) and although they say it clocks in around 60 lbs, I find it much lighter than anticipated when putting the bike in my car."

/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudet4w/,60 miles is a pretty serious ride.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudglj2/,I was in a similar boat.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudglj2/,I did a dry run of the trip on a day I didn't have to be there.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudglj2/,That gave me an understanding of how long it would take and where the sketchier parts of the ride were.

/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudglj2/,That way you can keep it fun and ease into twice a week as you get more comfortable.

/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudq4aq/,Averaging 20 mph isn't realistic for most commutes.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudq4aq/,"There are probably 20 minutes of stop lights (slowing, waiting, accelerating) so even with a 20mph pace OP is looking at 1hr 50m. You'd need a &gt; 25mph pace to do that in 90 minutes."
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudq4aq/,That's not counting times when you're forced to use the sidewalk and won't be able to realistically go faster than 15mph.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,Depends on a lot of factors like battery voltage and amps hours as well as how much time you‚Äôre going to spend on throttle versus pedal assist.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,If you strategize it‚Äôs totally doable.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/, My first suggestion would be to do your research on a battery big enough.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,"
And if you already started with that then I would go to try to figure out different charging methods."
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,What I mean by this is any way you can charge it during downtime via wall charger solar trickle charge even if you put like a high powered miniature detachable windmill (like the wind lilly) I know that sounds crazy but it‚Äôs thinking ahead every lil bit helps etc etc.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,If you don‚Äôt get a battery big enough maybe get to 35 amp hour batteries keep one in your backpack as back up.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,Also plan strategic stops Along the way just plot out checkpoints just in case you break down.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,Maybe some of these could have creek beds or moving bodies of water get yourself water lily same thing as a win Lily but without the extra attachments you can even daisychain these to make more power.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,You just have to get creative and always be thinking ahead.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,Also always take into a factor that your batteries full capacity and amp hours is the full range that you can get so I typically cut that in half for any commute so if I have a 30 amp hour battery I technically only have 15 amp hours to a destination and back.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/,Therefore if I know I‚Äôm going to be somewhere far away I charge while I‚Äôm there anyway that I can.
/r/ebikes/comments/yhbjmf/riding_ebike_to_commute_6o_miles_two_times_in_a/iudqkwy/," Might wanna also consider I‚Äôm going to tubeless with slime or flat out , foam inserts to protect the rims , heavy duty patch kits also spare tires with a good Tpi rating."

I did try a 3 Day rental to do some ""dry runs"" of my commutes and with my situation I would likely be able to charge at work though a second battery would be ideal as I did run low on one of my 40mile trips and pedaling 65+lbs across 15+miles of long hills at night was NOT fun."
